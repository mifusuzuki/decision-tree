## Findings

### 1.1 Besides the number of instances, what is another main difference between train full.txt and
train sub.txt?



### 1.2 What kind of attributes are provided in the dataset (Binary? Categorical/Discrete? Integers? Real numbers?) What are the ranges for each attribute in train full.txt?

### 1. 3 train noisy.txt is actually a corrupted version of train full.txt, where we have replaced the ground truth labels with the output of a simple automatic classifier. What proportion of labels in train noisy.txt is different than from those in train full.txt?(Note that the observations in both datasets are the same, although the ordering is different). Has the class distribution been affected? Specify which classes have a substantially larger or smaller number of examplesin train noisy.txt compared to train full.txt.
